# E-COMMERCE-SNEAKERS-STORE  

## 💡 Objective

The objectives of the challenge proposed by [Frontendmentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ecommerce-product-page-UPsZ9MJp6) must make a page where the user can add items to the cart, pass images and open the image modal. I wanted to go further and apply the knowledge gained in the courses  [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/) and [JStack](https://jstack.com.br/).

The core objective was to create a functional website structure where the user can browse, add and remove products from cart, filter by brand and price.

On the home page, the user can navigate the banner and perform the slide action, in the categories section three categories will be randomly rendered and the user can swipe product cards by clicking on the arrows or dragging the cards to the side;

On the Men page, the user can sort products by brand, highest rating, lowest and highest price. Clicking on a product redirects the user to that product's page for more information. When adding products to the cart and the mouse to the cart icon, a brief summary of the added products opens and it is possible to remove them.
